# Why I created this
I wanted a fun way for the members of my Hack Club to contribute to a collaborative playlist without needing a Spotify account. Surprisingly, I couldn't find anything like this online, so I made it myself! This was the first (and certainly not the last) time I've ever dived into using REST APIs.
